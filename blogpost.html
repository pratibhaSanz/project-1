        <p class="font1">In signal processing, data compression, source coding,[1] or bit-rate reduction is the process
            of encoding information using fewer bits than the original representation.[2] Any particular compression is
            either lossy or lossless. Lossless compression reduces bits by identifying and eliminating statistical
            redundancy. No information is lost in lossless compression. Lossy compression reduces bits by removing
            unnecessary or less important information.[3] Typically, a device that performs data compression is referred
